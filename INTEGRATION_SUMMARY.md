## 🚀 How It Works Now

### User Flow:

1. User types message → Presses Enter
2. Message appears in chat immediately
3. Typing indicator shows ("AI is thinking..." with animated dots)
4. Input is disabled to prevent spam
5. API request sent to Gemini backend
6. Response received (1-5 seconds typically)
7. Typing indicator replaced with AI response
8. Input re-enabled for next message

## 🔧 Configuration

### API Endpoint

```javascript
// frontend/src/config/api.js
CHAT_URL: "https://cyphers101.onrender.com/api/chat";
```

### Timeout & Retries

```javascript
TIMEOUT: 30000,        // 30 seconds
RETRY_ATTEMPTS: 2      // 2 tries before error
```

### To Change API URL:

Edit `frontend/src/config/api.js` - all API calls use this centralized config.

   - Visual feedback on hover

3. **Error Messages**

   - User-friendly error text

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: First request is very slow

**Cause:** Render free tier sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity  
**Solution:** Wait 30 seconds for cold start, subsequent requests are fast  
**Fix:** Keep a tab open or upgrade Render plan

### Issue: "Failed to connect"

**Cause:** Network issue or Render instance down  
**Solution:** Check Render dashboard, test API with curl  
**Fix:** Restart Render instance if needed
